**1. Set up your React.js project:**

- Create a new React.js project if you haven't already using tools like Create React App.
- Set up any necessary dependencies such as `react-dropzone` for drag-and-drop functionality.

**2. Create a component for the CSV importer:**

- Create a React component that will serve as the CSV importer.
- Implement the drag-and-drop functionality using the `react-dropzone` or similar library.

- Handle scenarios such as duplicate data, invalid column selections, or data format issues.

**8. Testing and validation:**
